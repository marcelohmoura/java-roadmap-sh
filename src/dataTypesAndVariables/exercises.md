### Exercises
1. In the company we work for, there are tables with each month's expenses. To close the balance sheet for the first quarter, we need to add up the total spend. Knowing that, in January, 15 thousand reais were spent, in February, 23 thousand reais and, in March, 17 thousand reais, make a program that calculates and prints the total expense in the quarter and the monthly average of expenses.

2. Write a program that prompts the user for name, age, and city of residence. Then display this information on the console in a single line, formatted as follows: "Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old and live in {city}.".

3. Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The user must enter the values of the sides of the rectangle. The program should display the results on the console, with proper formatting.

4. Implement a program that calculates a person's body mass index (BMI). The program should ask the user for his weight (in kilograms) and his height (in meters). Then calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height). Display the result on the console, to two decimal places.

5. Create a program that simulates an ATM. The program should ask the user to enter the amount he wants to withdraw. Next, the program must calculate the amount of banknotes of each value available (R$100, R$50, R$20, R$10) needed for the withdrawal and display this information on the console. Consider that the ATM has an infinite number of bills of each denomination.

6. Create a program that takes a sentence as input from the user and counts how many words are in that sentence. Then display the number of words in the console.

7. Implement a program that takes a word as user input and checks to see if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same from left to right as it reads from right to left. Display the result on the console.

8. Create a class called "Person" that has the attributes "name" and "age". Then create an array of objects of that class to store
information from multiple people. Implement a method that takes this array as a parameter and returns the average age of the people contained in it.

9. Develop a program that takes a list of integers as input from the user. Then sort this list in ascending order and display it in the console.

10. Create a class called "Phonebook" that has an array of objects from the "Contact" class. Each "Contact" object must store information such as name, phone and email. Implement methods in the "Phonebook" class to add a new contact, search for a contact by name and display all contacts in the agenda.
